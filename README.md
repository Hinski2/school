# School Exercises Repository

This repository contains my solutions to various university coursework assignments. It serves two main purposes:

1. **Sharing**: Provide detailed, step-by-step solutions to exercises for students who are struggling.
2. **Portfolio**: Showcase my academic projects and programming skills to potential employers.

## Subjects

The repository covers the following courses:

- **Algorithms and Data Structures** (`aisd/`)
- **Algebra** (`algebra/`)
- **Practical Algorithmics** (`algorytmikaPraktyczna/`)
- **Numerical Analysis** (`analizaNumeryczna/`)
- **Computer Systems Architecture** (`ask/`)
- **Programming Methods** (`metodyProgramowania/`)
- **Machine Learning** (`ml/`)
- **Artificial Intelligence** (`sztucznaInteligencja/`)
- **Selected Topics in Software Programming Practice** (`weppo/`)

## Repository Structure
